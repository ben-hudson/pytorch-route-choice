# pytorch-route-choice
This package has PyTorch implementations of some route choice models.
- `MarkovRouteChoice` implements "A link based network route choice model with unrestricted choice set" (Fosgerau et al., 2013).
    - It can also be used to implement "Maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning" (Ziebart et al., 2008).
- `PURC` implements "A perturbed utility route choice model" (Fosgerau et al., 2022)
